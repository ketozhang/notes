## Historical Growth

Investors use historical growth of business metrics to gauge the chance of growth in the future:

- Income Statement
  Consistent growth in revenue and EPS may indicate growth in price. A good growth investing candidate have their earnings growth about the same or better than its revenue.

- Cash Flow Statement
  Instead of using earnings, you may use cash flow which is different than earning because earning is places assumptions on its sales.

- Stock Price
  Growth in stock price may continue to grow because it's an direct indicator of profit and attracts even more investors.
