#  Options Pricing

An option is derived from the price of the stock but is also effected by time (negatively) and implied volatility (also negatively). This model comes from the Black-Scholes formula.

## Implied Volatility

The amount of an option's premium attribute to a stock's perceived riskiness. The more implied volatility the more the option changes as the stock moves up and down. This has a few implications

* Because the stock is more volatile, more people buy options (to either hedge or see opportunity). This raises demand and drives up option price.
