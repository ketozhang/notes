## Types of Data Sets

The best data may be an exhaustive data set full of everything you need. This ideal data set is called a **census**. 

More commonly one often would uses a **subset** or **sample** of a census. There are many types depending on how they were collection and who participated:

* **Chance: ** Randomly selected participants of the data
* **Self-selected: ** People are able to participate by choice.
* **Administrative database: ** A conveniently formed data set from initially collected for administration purposes.

## Types of Samples

### Judgmental Sample

Only certain people are able to become participants determined by the method.

### Simple Random Sample

A **simple random sample (SRS)** is a sample where each possible choice gets an equal chance to participate or be chosen.

$$P_1 = P_2 = ...=P_n$$

SRS is the most ideal however not always possible.

### Cluster Sample

A **cluster sample** is one which instead of each individual people are a sample, they are grouped into cluster or groups which are chosen as participants.

For example, if odd numbered participants are in group **O** and even numbered participants are in group **E**. If we chose group **O** to form $\text{Sample A}$, then we know for sure the probability that odd participants are in the sample and even participants are definitely not in the sample.,

$$\text{Group O}: \{1, 3, 5, ..., O\}$$

$$\text{Group E}: \{2, 4, 6, ..., E\}$$

$$P_1 = P_3 = ... = P_O = 1$$

$$P_2 = P_4 = ... = P_E = 0$$

* $E$ : Number of even participant
* $O$ : Number of odd participant

**Example in a Sentence**: 

> Grouping everyone by states and randomly choosing a state.

### Stratified Sample

Similar to cluster sample, **stratified sample** groups participants however instead we allow all members of a groups to be selected. In a stratified sample one may decide to select only one participant per group.

From here we may decide to choose one from each sample

**Example in a Sentence**: 

> Grouping everyone by states and randomly choosing a participant from each state.
