## Choosing a Statistics
Let's first begin with two categories. In two categories, it is best to look at only one as its proportions must add up to one anyways.

Count
: Literally count the cases of occurences in the category

Proportion
: The proportion of the cases of occurences in the category among all occurences.

Discrepency
: The proportion of the category observed that differs from the expected proportion.

    Large values of discrepency supports the alternative hypothesis.

## P-Value

The **observed significance level** or the more popular synonym the **P-value** is the chance:

* under the null hypothesis
* that the statistic
* is equal to the value that was observed in the data
* or is even further in the direction that supports the alternative.

## Error Probability

The probability that the P-value agrees with the alternative hypothesis. This is value is equivalent to confidence interval set for the null hypothesis.
