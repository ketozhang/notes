## Observation

Individual
: Study subjects, participants, units.

Treatment
: The independent variable.

Outcome
: The result of the dependent variable.

Association
: The relation between the treatment and the outcome.

    * This can just be a simple observation of correlation.

Causation
: The relationship that the treatment causes the effects of the outcome.

    * If there exist a causation, then the same individual obtaining the treatment (or not) would indeed have experience the outcome.

Confounding Factors
: Treatment that seemingly associate with an outcome but in actuality there is no causation or there's an underlying factor in the treatment that better explain the outcome.

    * Ex: "_People who wear gemstones are healther_". An underlying factor may be those who wear gemstones have more money thus can afford better healthcare.
