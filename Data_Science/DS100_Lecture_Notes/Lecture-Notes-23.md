## Hypothesis Testing

Null Model
: Probability model for explaining the chance process for generating the data

Test Statistic
: Summary of data, under the null model it has a sampling distribution

Null Hypothesis
: Any deviation from what is expected is due to chance variability described by the null model.

Alternative Hypothesis
: An alternative to the null hypothesis. This may be as simple as "the difference is real".

p-value
: The probability of the observed event or an event rarer than the observed under the assumption of the null model.

    * Low p-value does not prove that null model is false
    * Low p-value signifies that the null hypothesis can be rejected
    * Typical p-value that is considered low drawn at $p=0.05$ (a rule of thumb but not words to live by)
