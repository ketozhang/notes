To begin talking about random forest we need to cover bagging.

## Bagging 

Bootsrap Aggregating or Bagging is done by training $T$ trees where for each tree it is trained by some dataset $X' \subseteq X$ where $X'$ is generated by sampling $n'$ samples from $X$ with replacement.

## Random Forest

Now, random forest takes bagging and add another randomness to the features used by each tree. Here, each tree takes $d' < d$ features randomly sampled without replacement from the features.

* For classification use $d' \approx \sqrt{d}$.
* For regression use $d' \approx d/3$.
