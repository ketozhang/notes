**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are used for amount of features that implements same transformation to different subsets of the features. CNNs are often used for images hence features are pixel values and a single convolution is a single subset of the image being transformed.

CNN implements the ideas of,

* Local connectivity: A hidden unit connecting to small patch of units in the previous layer
* Shared weights: Groups of hidden units share same set of input weights called mask, filters, or kernels.
