#  Geometric Distribution

The probability of the first success given by $p$ to be at position $n$.

$$
\begin{gather*}
    X \sim \text{Geometric}(p)\\
    P (X = n) = q^{n-1}p,\quad \qquad p+q=1
\end{gather*}
$$

Expectation
:   $$ E[X] = \frac{1}{p} $$


    ::: Proof
    The expected value of first success after $W$ can be done quickly by noticing

    * There must be at least one trial.
    * If the first trial succeeds (with probability $p$), $W=1$.
    * If the first trial fails (with probability $q$), the remaining trials is also distributed equallty to $W$.


    Let $W = 1 + R$ where $R$ is the random variable for the number of trials after the first. Let $W'$ be distributed equallty to $W$.

    $$
    W = 1 + R\\
    $$

    $$
    \begin{align}
        \mathbb E[W] &= 1 + \mathbb E[R]\\
        &= 1 + q\mathbb E[W']\\
        &= 1 + q\mathbb E[W]\\
    \end{align}
    $$

    $$
    \mathbb E[W] = \frac{1}{q}
    $$

Variance
:    $$E[X^2] = \frac{q}{p^2} $$

    ::: Proof
    We can prove this using conditional variance. Notice that $X$ can be expressed as a mixture of two distributions: a constant with chance $p$, and IID $1 + X^*$ with chance $q$

    $$
    \begin{gather*}
    P(X=1) = p \\
    P(X = 1 + X^*) = q
    \end{gather*}
    $$

    The variance by conditioning is then,

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \text{Var}(X) &= [\text{Var}(1) + E(1)^2]p + [\text{Var}(1+X^*) + E(1 + X^*)^2]q - E(X)^2\\
    &= p + \left[\text{Var(X)} + \frac{1}{p^2} + 1 \right]q - \frac{1}{p^2}\\
    &= \frac{1-p}{p^2}\\
    &= \frac{q}{p^2}
    \end{align*}
    $$

## Coupon Collector's Problem

Let's say there are $n$ types of coupons and you need all $n$ to win a prize. To get a coupon you must buy some product.

1. What is the expected number of buys to get all $n$ coupons given uniform probability of getting any coupon.

    Let $X_i$ be the random variable of the number of buys to get a unique coupon. You need $n$ unique coupons so the number of buys to win a prize is the sum of $X_i$.

    $$
    \mathbb E[X_i] = \frac{1}{p_i} = \frac{n}{n-(i-1)}\\
    \mathbb E\left [\sum{X_i} \right] = n \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}
    $$
