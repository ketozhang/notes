#  Introduction to Clustering

A method to partition data into groups of similarity or nearby points. Some usage of clustering includes:

* Discovery (e.g., finding new similar songs)
* Hierarchy (e.g., finding taxonomy of species from genes)
* Quantization: compress data by reducing choices
* Graph partitioning: (e.g., Image segmentation or find groups in social networks)
