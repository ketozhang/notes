# Heat Capacity
Heat capacity is the amount of __thermal energy__ a system can hold per change in temperature.

$$C \equiv \left(\frac{dU}{d\tau}\right)_\text{const}$$ 

* Heat capacity is not very useful and cannot be defined for a system that doesn't keep either pressure ($P$) or volume ($V$) constant. 
* Without keeping pressure or volume constant system the energy is often transfered to work ($dW = PdV + VdP$)
# Isovolumetric Heat Capacity 
# Isobaric Heat Capacity 
# Chemical Heat Capacity
