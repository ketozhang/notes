#  Second Quantization

Let the set of annihilation and creator operators in both position and momentum be related by,

$$
\hat a_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{p}\hat a(p) e^{i p \cdot x}\\
\hat a^\dagger_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}} \sum_{p}\hat a(p)^\dagger e^{i p \cdot x}
$$

The number operator for the corresponding number of particles in some position and momentum be,

$$
\hat n_x = a^\dagger_xa_x\\
\hat n(p) = a^\dagger(p)a(p)
$$

The basic usage of these operators are simply by the examples below:

* Create a particle at position $x$ starting at a field with no particles $\ket 0$,

    $$
    \ket 1 = a_x^\dagger \ket 0\\
    $$

* Find the number of particles at position $x$ for a field with two particles

    $$
    \ket 2 = (a_x^\dagger)^2 \ket 0 \\
    n_x \ket 2 = 2 \ket 2
    $$

* Find the position of a particle at position $x$ by determining the position PDF with some general position state $\ket{x'}$,

    $$
    \ket 1 = a^\dagger\\
    \braket{x'}{1} = \delta(x-x')
    $$

    Thus the particle only exist at position $x'$.

## Lagrangian and Hamiltonian

Let's begin by writing the Lagrangian for two particles in a continuous field. It's a lot to write so let's drop the hat on every variable (if you like, you can justify this by noting that a constant is just an operator with itself as the eigenvalue and every vector is an eigenvector).

$$
L = \int \left[i\hbar a^\dagger_x a_x - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla a_x^\dagger \nabla a_x - \lambda a^\dagger_x a^\dagger_x a_x a_x\right] \d^3 x
$$

$$
H = \int{\left[\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla a_x^\dagger \nabla a_x + \lambda a^\dagger_x a^\dagger_x a_x a_x\right]\d^3 x}
$$

## Wavefunction

The wavefunction is a state generated by applying the annihilation and creation operators thus it follows in continuous space with $N$ particles is generated by,

$$
\ket{\Psi} = \int \prod_{i=1}^N a^\dagger_x \ket{0} \d^3 x_i
$$

## Schrodinger Equation

The Schrodinger equation is still valid with this second quanitzation, recall

$$
i\hbar \dot \Psi = H \Psi
$$

### Proof

The proof is not very pretty and requires induction to prove for any number of particles $N \in \mathbb C$. Let's begin with two particle state at some arbritrary position $x_1$ and $x_2$.

$$
\ket{2} := \ket{\Psi(x_1, x_2, t)}\\
\ket{\Psi(x_1, x_2, t)} = \int a_{x_1}^\dagger a^\dagger_{x_2} \ket{0} \Psi(x_1, x_2, t) \d^3 x_1\,\d^3 x_2
$$

It's tedious to write the index of position $x$ so let,

$$
x := x_1\\
y := x_2\\
$$

$$
\ket{2} = \int a_{x}^\dagger a^\dagger_{y} \ket{0} \Psi\, \d^3 x\,\d^3 y
$$

We proceed the proof by showing that $i\hbar \dot{\ket{2}} = H\ket{2} $. The LHS is,

$$
i \hbar  \int a_{x}^\dagger a^\dagger_{y} \ket{0} \dot \Psi\; \d^3 x\,\d^3 y
$$

To apply the RHS, we rely heavily on the commutation relationship in order to move operators around,

$$
a_i^\dagger a_j - a_ja_i^\dagger = \delta^3(i-j)
$$

The goal is to move all creation operators to the left and anihilation operators to the right

## Second Quantization of an Operator

Similarly to how an single-particle operator in Hilbert space modifies the states of a single particle, in QFT we implore a set of Hilbert spaces called the **Fock space** which can describe our system of $N$ particles as the space $\mathcal F_N$. An operator that operates on the Fock space, thus operating on many particle is not surprisingly a matrix acted upon a single coordinate of the Fock space at $(\alpha, \beta)$. It can be compactly represented as

$$
\hat A = \sum_{\alpha \beta} A_{\alpha, \beta}a_\alpha^\dagger a_\beta
$$

* $\hat A_{\alpha, \beta}$ : Matrix element, $\bra{\alpha}\hat A\ket{\beta}$
