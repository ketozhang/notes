The drag force $f$ is a force of friction that proportional to the velocity of an object and is applied directly opposite to the velocity. We may write such force as a vector simply as,

$$\boldsymbol{f} = -f(v) \boldsymbol{\hat v}$$

A good approximation for the magnitude is the Taylor series noting that the first term goes to zero.

$$ f(v) \approx bv + cv^2 + ... $$

## Ideal Drag Approximation

If the object traveling is a perfect sphere and traveling much less than the speed of sound then we may approximate using the first two terms of $f(v)$,

$$ f(\nu) = 2r\beta  + 4r^2\gamma  $$

$r$ : radius of the object
