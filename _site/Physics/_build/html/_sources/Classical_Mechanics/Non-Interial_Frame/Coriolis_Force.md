#  Coriolis Force

The coriolis force is defined as,

$$ 2m\dot {\mathbf r} \times \boldsymbol \Omega$$

* $\dot{\mathbf r}$ : velocity vector of the object **relative to the  rotating frame**

Note that this is very similar to the force induced by a magnetic field ($\mathbf F_B = q\dot{\mathbf r} \times \mathbf \Omega $) that causes charged particles to spiral around a direction of the $B$-field. The exact same spiral occurs with the coriolis force but at a much weaker extent.
