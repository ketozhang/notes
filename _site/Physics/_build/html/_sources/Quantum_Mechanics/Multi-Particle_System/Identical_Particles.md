#  Identical Particles

If the particle were **identical** such that they were **indistinguishable** then statistics states that the system are no longer independent of each other. The wavefunction for a system of two identical particles is,

$$
\begin{equation}
    \psi(r_1, r_2)_\pm = A \left[\psi_a(r_1)\psi_b(r_2) \pm \psi_b(r_1)\psi_a(r_2)\right]
\end{equation}
$$

* $\psi_+$ : Wavefunction of bosons
* $\psi_-$ : Wavefunction of fermions
* The general equation for $N$ particles is not easy to write but easy to see the pattern. For $N=3$ identical particles, you have 3 products for each of the 3 terms. In combinatorics this is considered a sum of permutations.

## Exchange Relationship

Identical particles follows a property that if the particles were to be exchange, its wavefunction follows,

$$
\begin{equation}
    \psi(r_a,r_b) = \pm\psi(r_b,r_a)
\end{equation}
$$

* $+$ : bosons
* $-$ : fermions
