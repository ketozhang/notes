Type Ia supernovae (Ia) are most famously known for their standardizable property of their luminosity. With large numbers of Ia scattered across various distances, one can build a distance ruler to better make or calibrate distance measurements to other objects.

# Tripp Standardization

The de-facto standard method used for standardization is the two-parameter luminosity correction ([Tripp 1998](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1998A&A...331..815T/abstract)).

\[
  \mu = m_\text{B} - \Big(M_\text{B} + \alpha \Delta_{m15} + \beta (B-V) \Big)
\]

* $\Delta_{m15}$, the difference in magnitude at day of maximum light to 15 days after.
