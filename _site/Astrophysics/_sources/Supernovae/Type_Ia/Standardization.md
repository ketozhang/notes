Type Ia supernovae (Ia) are most famously known for their standardizable property of their luminosity. With large numbers of Ia scattered across various distances, one can build a distance ruler to better make or calibrate distance measurements to other objects.

# Tripp Standardization

The de-facto standard method used for standardization is the two-parameter luminosity correction ([Tripp 1998](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1998A&A...331..815T/abstract)). In magnitudes:

$$
\hat M_B = M_B + \alpha \Delta_{m15} + \beta (B-V)
$$
$$
  \mu = m_\text{B} - \hat M_B
$$

* $\Delta_{m15}$, the difference in magnitude at day of maximum light to 15 days after.
