#  Flux

## Flux

The power of the emitting source on a unit surface area. Also known as **bolometric flux** or **radiant flux** in astronomy and **irradiance** in other fields. The SI units are watt per square meter.

\[
  F = \frac{\partial L}{\partial A}
\]

Where $F$ is flux, $L$ is luminosity or power, and $A$ is the area.

## Spectral Flux

The power of the emitting source on a unit surface area for a unit wavelength. Also known as **spectral irradiance** in other fields. The SI units are watt per square meter per meter.

\[
  F_\lambda = \frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda}
\]

Where $F_\lambda$ is the spectral flux and $\lambda$ is the wavelength

You may also define the spectral flux in frequency instead of wavelength.
