#  Ellipse

## Eccentricity

## Semi-Major and Semi-Minor Axis

The semi-major and semi-minor axis (sometimes called together as the semiparameters) are axis perpendicular and intersected at the center of the ellipse.

Let $a$ be the length of the semi-major axis and $b$ be the length of the semi-minor axis:

$$
a = r\frac{1 + e\cos{\nu}}{1+e^2}\\
b = r\frac{1 + e\cos{\nu}}{1-e^2}\\
\frac{b}{a} = \sqrt{1-e^2}
$$
