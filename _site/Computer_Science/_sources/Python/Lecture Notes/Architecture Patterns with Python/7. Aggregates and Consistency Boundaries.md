This chapter concerns the need to add rules (i.e., specifically [[#Invariants and Constraints]]) from our domain to the domain layer. There are challenges applying these rules when it comes to scaling our application with concurrency.
## Invariants and Constraints
**Constraint** limits the possible state of our domain models while **invariants** is a statement about our domain model that must be true.

## Aggregate Design Pattern

When it comes to scaling with concurrency, it may be difficult to maintain invariants and constraints because each processing unit holds its own state of your domain objects. Centralizing the domain state into a database with lock will work at smaller scales, but the deadlocks it may introduce will hinder your application at larger scale. The aggregate design pattern intends to solve this problem.

The aggregate design pattern wraps multiple domain models into one domain model that is useful to be represented as part of our atomic transaction (see [[6. Unit of Work Pattern]]). The aggregated domain model is handled by a single processing unit who is worried about invariants and constraints, but does not worry about other processing happening concurrently.

### Avoiding the God Object
A **god object** (or omniscient object) is a domain data model that attempt to encapsulate every aspect of the domain. It is very tempting to implement one of these when designing an aggregate domain model. It may be convenient to have all domain information in one domain model, but in practice this leads to exposing information that is out of scope to the context where the domain object is used.

Instead, you may define multiple aggregate domain model where each has their assigned **bounded context**. Although the domain model may represent the same thing, the information it only contains what’s relevant to its bounded context.

### Using the Aggregate 

- Refactor the Repository pattern
    - Enforce that all repositories must return an instance of the aggregate domain model.

### Concurrency

We’ve promised that the aggregate design pattern can scale with concurrency. Now how does two aggregate objects that together violates one of the invariants or constraints work together?

One solution is to only accept one of the aggregates, for example accepting only the first. The layer that would interact with both object is the database layer. However instead of the database layer knowing the constraints and invariants of the objects making up the aggregate object, the database should be able accept/reject an aggregate by one of its fields. A common field to add is some version number that is incremented when the aggregate object goes through an uncommitted change.

There are plenty other solution—a [few listed](https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_07_aggregate.html#_enforcing_concurrency_rules_by_using_database_transaction_isolation_levels) in the textbook.
