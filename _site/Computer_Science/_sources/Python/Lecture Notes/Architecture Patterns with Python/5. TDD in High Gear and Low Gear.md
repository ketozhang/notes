## Moving tests from Domain layer to Service layer
Once you have your service layer, you may move your unit test from the domain layer to the service layer. The benefits you get are:

- You donâ€™t have to rewrite your test if your domain layer changes.
- Tests on the service layer do not need to interact with private methods.

However we lose the benefit of working with the domain layer:

- You get to work directly with the domain logic giving more comfort.
- It is easier to use when testing out a new feature.
