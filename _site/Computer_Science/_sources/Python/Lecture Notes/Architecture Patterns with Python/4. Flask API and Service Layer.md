**Ice-Cream Cone Model**  
When there exist more tests on the higher abstraction than the lower abstraction layer.

For example, if we define the layers of testing to be unit, integration, E2E, and manual tests ordered by low to high. An ice-cream cone model will have bulk of the tests be on the manual and E2E.


**Reducing tests on the higher layer**  
Many tests on the higher layer may indicate the thing under test is handling too many responsibilities.

- Adding a service layer between the application interface and domain layer
    ```python
    def is_valid_sku(sku, batches):
        return sku in {b.sku for b in batches}
    
    
    @app.route("/allocate", methods=["POST"])
    def allocate_endpoint():
        session = get_session()
        batches = repository.SqlAlchemyRepository(session).list()
        line = model.OrderLine(
            request.json["orderid"], request.json["sku"], request.json["qty"],
        )
    
        if not is_valid_sku(line.sku, batches):
            return {"message": f"Invalid sku {line.sku}"}, 400
    
        try:
            batchref = model.allocate(line, batches)
        except model.OutOfStock as e:
            return {"message": str(e)}, 400
    
        session.commit()
        return {"batchref": batchref}, 201
    ```
    Here the endpoint is handling both logic if whether the SKU is in the batch and whether the item is out of stock. Testing at this layer would have to handle good/bad cases for each path.
    
    Reducing this endpoint’s responsibility to one would move all the logic of allocating an item to a batch to a separate layer—the service layer. We’ve then move the unit tests to be for the service layer. The tests for this endpoint need only to check if the 400 and 201 scenarios.
    
- Other times, it might be better to move the logic into the domain model instead.  
  In the above example, it could be the domain model’s job to know if the SKU exist in the batch it’s about to allocate to.
