After decoupling the domain layer from your application, your application is still talking to the service layer, repository layer, and database layer. The latter two is only used because the application needs to get a database session from the database layer and pass it to the repository layer.

With the **unit of work pattern**, a layer is added to wrap the repository and database layer defining. As its name suggests it also provides the behavior of atomicity.

```python
class AbstractUnitOfWork(ABC):
    """Derived class will implement a context where once the block exits,
    changes are committed if there are no error.
    """
    # UOW directly talks with the repository layer
    repository: AbstractRepository

    @abstractmethod
    def __enter__(self):
        """Instantiates the repository with a session"""
        # UOW will interact with the database layer to open and close sessions.
        pass

    def __exit__(self, *args):
       self.rollback() 

    @abstractmethod
    def commit(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def rollback(self):
        pass
```

The service layer will interact with the unit of work layer. For example, we can use dependency injection to explicitly use the UOW layer:

```python
def service_function(..., uow: AbstractUnitOfWOrk, *args, **kwargs):
    with uow:
        ... # Do something
```
