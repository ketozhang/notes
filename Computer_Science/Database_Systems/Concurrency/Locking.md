#  Locking

The locking scheme we will be using is called the **Two Phase Lock (2PL)** to guarantee conflict serializable schedule. The two phases refer to the phases of individual transactions. Those are:

1. **Aquisition Phase**

    Transaction begins by attempting to gather all the locks it can will need. Afterso, we have entered the **lockpoint**

2. **Release Phase**

    Transaction will begin releasing (all at once if Strict 2PL). Transaction can get no more lock after releasing at least one.

## Types of Locks

* **Shared Lock (S or R)**: A lock for reading.
    * More than one transaction can have a shared lock.
    * Cannot use the shared lock unless the exlusive lock is unlocked

* **Exclusive Lock (X or W)**: A lock for writing
    * Only one transaction can have a write lock.
    * Can only get a exclusive lock if both shared and exclusive are unlocked.


## Stirct 2PL and Cascade Abort

* **Cascade abort**

    When transaction abort causes other transaction to abort and undo. This occurs because when a transaction release its lock to another transaction, that transaction will continue its actions regarldess if there's an abort ahead.

The fix for cascade abort is to make sure all transaction:

    1. Release all locks together.
    2. Only release during a commit or abort.

This is the the policy **Strict 2PL**

## Lock Manager

The lock manager (LM) maintains a table (often hash table) called the that stores the following columns:

* Object name
* Set of transactions ids currently with that lock
* Lock type
* A priority waiting queue of transactions needing the lock.

## Deadlock

A deadlock occurs when the wait-for diagram is cyclic. A **waits-for** diagram is the directed graph representing the lock manager. The nodes are transactions and the edges are the relations where a transaction waits for (points to) another transaction to release.

### Deadline Avoidance

**Deadlock avoidance** determines the action if some transaction wants a lock that's taken from another.

* **Wait-Die**
    * Higher priority: wait
    * Lower priority: die

* **Wound-Wait**
    * Higher priority: take over
    * Lower priroity: wait

### Deadlock Detection

The lock manager can detect deadlocks by creating a waits-for graph. Upon finding a cycle, we can abort one of the transaction.

## Multi-Granularity Locking

We have the issue on how granular should we be locking (e.g., tables, pages, records). To solve this we introduce new locks called the **intent locks**:

There are 3 intent locks **IS, IX, SIX**.

* To get an S or IS lock you need an IS or IX lock on the parent node.
* To get an X, IX, or SIX you need a IX or SIX on the parent node.
* Any node getting an $S$ or $X$ lock implies that the lower level also has the same lock.

### Lock Compatibility

The following tables reperesents combination of locks that do not conflict given two different transactions on the locking the same object.
