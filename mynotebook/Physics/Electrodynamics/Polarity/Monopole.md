title: Monopole

The monopole is the first term ($n=0$) of the multipole expansion. For a charge source of total charge $Q$,

$$
V(\boldsymbol r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r}
$$

This equation mirrors the exact potential for a point charge at distance $d=r$ where we center the origin at the point charge.
