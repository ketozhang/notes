## Phase

Recall the time solution of the Schrodinger equation is given by,

$$
\phi(x,t) \sim \exp\left[-\frac{i}{\hbar}Et\right]
$$

We call the $E$ (energy of the photon), the phase factor. In classical particles the phase factor is $S$:

$$
\phi(x,t) \sim \exp\left[ i S / \hbar\right]
$$

where we note that the principle of least action $\delta S / \delta x(t) = 0$ causes $\partial \phi / \partial t = 0$.

Intuitively, the classical particle considers all trajectory that cost some total action $S$. The observed trajectory is the one that gives a stationary action $\delta S / \delta x(t) = 0$.
