title: Distinguishable Particles
---

A system of distinguishable particles by statistics has a wavefunction equal to the product of each individual particle's wavefunction,

$$
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x) = \prod_j{\psi_j(r_j)}
\end{equation}
$$

This property comes from the probability of independent systems.
