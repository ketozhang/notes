#  Factory Method

Separates object (**product**) creation from usage in the main class (**creator**). The creation of the object is done in the superclass but allows the subclass to alter the type of objects to be created.

```puml
@startuml
Creator --right> Product
Creator <|-- ConcreteCreatorA
Creator <|-- ConcreteCreatorB
Product <|-- ConcreteProductA
Product <|-- ConcreteProductB

abstract Creator {
  ...
  useProduct()
  {abstract} createProduct(): Product
}
note left of Creator::useProduct
  product = createProduct()
  product.doSomething()
end note

note left of Creator::createProduct
  Factory method
end note

interface Product {
  doSomething()
}

class ConcreteCreatorA {
  createProduct(): Product
}
note right of ConcreteCreatorA::createProduct
  return ConcreteProductA()
end note

class ConcreteCreatorB {
  createProduct(): Product
}

# Usage

The separation of creation and usage is the core purpose of the factory method. Therefore, the advantages are:

* New product types are created from implementing the product and subclassing the creator.
* Allow external users to extend both usage and product types *a la* above
