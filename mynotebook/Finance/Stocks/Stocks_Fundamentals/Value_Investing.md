#  Value Investing

## Fundamentals

1. **P/E Ratio**: The value per earning. Look for a low (under 20) P/E ratio and also compare it with its industrial average.
1. **P/B Ratio**: The attractive value of shareholder's equity. Look for a low (under 1.0) P/B ratio.
1. **P/S Ratio**: The value per sales. Look for a low (under 2.0) P/S ratio.
1. **Return on Equity** (**ROE**): Return on investment where investment is the shareholder's equity. Look for high (above 10%) ROE.
1. **Debt-to-Captial Ratio**: The percentage of capital the company has as debt. Look for a low (under 25%) debt-to-capital ratio.
1. **Volume**: Trading activity in number of shares in a day. Avoid very low volume. High volume indicates a healthy stock. Look for high (above 250k) volume.

## Technical

Just the fundamentals may not be enough, an investor would like to know if the stock price would be stable such that eventually people would realize the intrinsic value of the stock.

1. **Trend**: Generally avoid large downtrending and even large uptrending stocks as return may take a long time to happen and margin of safety is difficult to calculate respectively. Instead look for a stock that's basing from a downtrend. Basing or plateuing means the trend is heading towards a region where highs and lows changes are equal.

## Intrinsic Value

With a shorter list filtered by fundamentals and/or technicals, we now can efficiently calculate the intrinsic value for each stock.

1. **DCF**: Use the discounted cash flow for the intrinsic value.
1. **Margin of Safety**: A good candidate is if the margin of safety is above 25%.

## Timing

1. **Entry Signal**: Using technicals like the 200-day SMA, can help investors determine when to buy the stock. If the price is above SMA, this indicates the stock may be heading towards the intrinsic value. There is a larger confidence of this signal towards the end of the week rather than the middle.
1. **Exit Signal**: Investors may place a stop order or alert to mitigate loss (e.g., 3% below the buy price or any support level). Investors may place a limit order or alert if the stock hits the intrinsic price.

## Management

1. **Trade risk**: The difference between the buy price and investor's personal stop price. More simply an investor may just decide the trade risk to be a percentage of the buy price. Initially the buy price is the support and new support may come up.
1. **New Support**: Over the growth, more general change, of a stock, a new support (e.g., a plateau) may arise. An investor can use this as a new baseline or support to adjust the stop price (e.g., 3% below the new support).
1. **New Outlook**: Another reason to change the stop price is if the outlook of the company changes.
1. **Portfolio Risk**:
   $$
   [\text{# Shares to Buy}] = \frac{[\text{Portfolio Risk}]}{[\text{Trade Risk}]}
   $$

## Routines

- **Daily**:

  - Re-adjust stops
  - Monitor watch list for entry signal

- **Weekly**:

  - Plan for next week by reading news for earnings announcements, dividents, and economic effects.
  - Add new value stocks to candidate list
  - Remove stocks from watch list who doesn't meet criteria

- **Monthly/Quarterly**:
  - Earning releases
  - Record trades
  - Were entries, stops, and exits performed effectively
  - Are my growth rate and discount rate assumptions accurate
  - Are my large portfolio allocations appropriate
