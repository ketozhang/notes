title: Simple Moving Average
---

The **simple moving average** (**SMA**) for the stock price is a time series for each time the previous $N$-periods (often days) are average.

Often used is the 200-day SMA to be compared with the current price

- If the current price is long above the SMA, this indicates that the price momentum is changing upwards potentially towards the intrinsic value.
