title: Price to Earning Ratio
---

The P/E ratio is the dollar amount an investor is willing to pay per dollar of annual earning. It is calculated by,

$$
[\text{P/E}] = \frac{[\text{Stock Price}]}{[\text{EPS}]}
$$

Where EPS is the annual earning per share,

$$
[\text{EPS}] = \frac{[\text{Annual Earning}]}{[\text{# of Shares}]}
$$

## Value Investing

A value investor will look into lower P/E ratio as it is a sign of undervalued stocks.

## Growth Investing

A growth investor will look into higher P/E ratio as it is a sign of potential growth higher than expected.
