#  Price to Sale Ratio

Replacing earnings with sales, the P/S ratio is the dollar amount an investor is willing to pay per dollar amount the company sells

$$
[\text{P/E}] = \frac{[\text{Stock Price}]}{[\text{SPS}]}
$$

Where SPS is the annual sale per share,

$$
[\text{SPS}] = \frac{[\text{Annual Sale}]}{[\text{# of Shares}]}
$$

## Relation to P/E Ratio

The P/S ratio is used to compare with the P/E ratio as an efficiency measurement. A good company should have high earnings compared to their sales thus high P/E compared to P/S ratio.
