# Nomenclature
Let's do some fast definitions:

**Asteroids**  
A general term for rocky minor planets

**Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNO)**  
The most small bodies in our Solar System lies beyond Neptune's orbit thus called TNOs.

* **Kuiper Belt Objects (KBO)**  
    Icy bodies living in the Kuiper belt (low inclination and eccentricity orbits) that are also TNOs.

    The most famous KBO is **Pluto** (first discovered) and **Ceres**


**Near Earth Objects (NEO)**  
Objects that come near Earth with perihelia of less than ~1.3 AU.

The dynamical lifetime of NEOs is at max ~$10^7$ yrs

**Trojan Asteroids**  
Asteroids that orbit the Lagrangian points of Jupiter.

# Oort Cloud
## Sedna
90377 Sedna is a KBO and was discovered at a perihelion of 76 AU and aphelion of 900AU which is phenomenal.

* Sedna is considered to live in the inner Oort cloud.
* It is unknown why Sedna orbits so much further than the rest. Most theorize a perturbation of some sort either by stars, a far planet, or came from somewhere else.

## Size Distribution
Due to numerous collisions in the early history of the Solar System it,the size distribution of the asteroid follows a power law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    N(R) &= \int_{R_0}^{R_1}{\frac{N_0}{R_0}\left(\frac{R}{R_0}\right)^{-\zeta} dR}\\
    N(R) &= \int_{R}^{R_\text{max}}{\frac{N_0}{\zeta - 1}\left(\frac{R}{R_0}\right)^{-\zeta} dR}
\end{aligned}
$$
