title: Curvature Constant
---

The curvature constant comes from the concept credited to Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevski who came up with the experiment that one can tell the curvature of the universe by drawing a large enough triangle. 

Consider the three angle of the triangle $\alpha,\; \beta,\; \gamma$. Recall that in Euclidean space (or common sense) that the three angle of the triangle should add up to $180^\circ = \pi$. In an non-Euclidean space there exist a generalized equation for the sum of these angles for an isosceles triangle is:

$$ 
\begin{equation}
    \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi + \frac{\kappa A}{R_0^2}
\end{equation}
$$

* $A$ : Area of the triangle
* $R_0$ : Radius of curvature of any side (notice the radius of curvature for a straight line is $\infty$)
* $\kappa$ : The curvature constant which is either $0$ or $ \pm 1$

Often times, we do not need to deal with this number much doing cosmology so we assign a different form of the **curvature constant**,

$$ 
\begin{equation}
    k \equiv \frac{\kappa}{R_0^2}
\end{equation}
