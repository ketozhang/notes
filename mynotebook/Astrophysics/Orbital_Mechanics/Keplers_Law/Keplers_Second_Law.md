title: Kepler's Second Law
---

Kepler's second law is most commonly stated as the sweeping motion of the satellite maps out equal area of the section for equal time intervals.

## Proof - Using Specific Angular Momentum

Recall from the [specific angular momentum](../Specific_Angular_Momentum) has the following relationship:

$$
h = r^2 \frac{\mathrm d \nu}{\mathrm d t}
$$

The differential area of the ellipse's sector is given by

```
TODO: Proof
```

$$
\mathrm d A = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \mathrm d \nu\\
d \nu = \frac{2}{r^2} \mathrm d A
$$

Joining the two equations,

$$
\mathrm dA = \frac{h}{2} \mathrm dt
$$

Because $h$ is constant with respect to time, any differential sector area is equal for the same differential time.
