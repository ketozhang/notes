#  Law of Large Numbers

For a sequence of iid random variables $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ let the **sample mean** be defined as,

$$ \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum{X_i} $$

As $n \rightarrow \infty$, the probability that the sample mean deviates from the population mean $\mu$ absolutely by some positive error $\epsilon$ tends to,

$$ P\left[\abs{\bar{X}- \mu} < \epsilon \right] \rightarrow 1 $$
