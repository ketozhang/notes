#  Convex Function

A convex function is a satisfied if for every pair of points $x_1 < x_2$, if you were to draw a line through the two points then there exists no value $x$ ($x_1 \le x \le x_2$) such that $f(x)$ is above the line. This condition implies two important properties of either:

* The convex function has no extrema
* The convex fucntion has a single extrema
* All extremum are global extrema.
