title: Ampere's Law
---

**Ampere's Law** is the curl of the magnetic field $\bvec B$,

$$
\nabla \times \bvec B = \mu_0 \bvec J
$$

## Integral Form
More often used is the integral form of Ampere's law

$$
\oint \bvec B \cdot \mathcal d \bvec l = \mu_0 I_\mathrm{enc}
$$

Note that this looks very similar to Gauss' law and it is used within the same geometric symmetry that Gauss' law is so great at.
