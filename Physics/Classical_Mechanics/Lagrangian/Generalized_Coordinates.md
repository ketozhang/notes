## Reducing Coordinates

Independent Coordinate and Momenta:
: If exist an generalized coordinate that the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ is independent of, say $\phi$ in the following coordinate

    $$
    \begin{gather}
        \boldsymbol{r} = \boldsymbol{r}(r,\phi)\\
        \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(r, \dot r, \dot \phi)
    \end{gather}
    $$

    > Even if $\mathcal{L}$ is dependent of $\dot \phi$, it is still independent of $\phi$.

: Then we are sure that the momenta of the independent coordinate is conserved. For $\phi$, angular momenta is conserved,

    $$ L_\phi = \text{const} $$

    $$  $$
