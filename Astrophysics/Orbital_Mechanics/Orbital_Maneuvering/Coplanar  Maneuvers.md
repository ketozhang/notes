title: Coplanar Maneuvers
---

Coplanar maneuvers are maneuvers that do not change the oribtal plane instead changes the orbit's size, shape, and location of the apsides.

For burns tangential to the orbit with the additional constraint that the burn only occur at the apoapsis and periapsis (flight-path angle is zero) we can perform the following maneuvers:

* Hohmann Transfers (two tangential burns)
* One-Tangent Burns (one tangential burn)
* General Transfers (two nongential burns)
